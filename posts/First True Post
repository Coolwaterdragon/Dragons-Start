title: The Day I Started

description: "After watching one too many informative TikTok videos, I have decided to create my own website. It seems that people all over the Internet suggest creating your own site for many reasons. Hell, if anything I see it as a way to just get something out there! Maybe I'll show my parents and say "Hey! look at this I created my own website!" It is certainly difficult at first like all things, and I haven't chosen the easiest way to do it, thats for certain. But I chose this way because it will force me to learn stuff I've never been drawn too very much, and who knows, maybe I'll enjoy it more than I once expected. It is already kind of nice to have an 'online journal' or blog, where I can write anything in. I'll never have to worry about loosing it as long as I know the URL, So in that way its better than any physical notebook. Its tough to know immediately what I would like to do with this website, maybe I can immortalize my cooking recipes, or talk about the games I've been enjoying recently. There certainly are a lot of great games coming out this year, and its hard to focus on one because it seems like as soon as one is out, the next shows up right behind it. First there was palworld which was controversial because of how similar it is to pokemon, and some people accused the devs of using AI to create models for the game. But it's super popular still and being played all over the world, so I doubt it's going to fade out anytime soon. It would be really cool to see a good update for the game, but I havent heard anything yet. You could say a shadow has been cast over it by 'Helldivers 2' because of the instant popularity of that game, the servers were constantly overflowing and forcing players into long wait times to get into the game, at least until the server cap was increased to 700,000. The first game, 'Helldivers' all time peak player count was only a little under 7k at ~6,900 so its no surprise that #2's servers were overflowing for so long, theres no way they could have expected such exponential success. The game certainly is extremely fun to play though. Personally, I already can't wait for new content to be added, like new weapons and stratagems (call in abilities). There has been lots of talk about a mech suit, and I've heard from one player that the developers have already finished programming it, and haven't added it because of the server problems up until recently. I don't know how true it is that they've already finished programming it, although I do kind of believe it (hopefully). "
optional conclusion line if i feel like adding it
